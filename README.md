# Summer of Code - 2025
CodeTitans: The Clash of the Algorithms

Mentor : Divyansh Agrawal

## Week 1 
I learnt about stacks, queues and priority queues. I first studied stacks and queues in Chapter 10 of Introduction to Algorithms, follows by video lectures on stacks, queues and priority queues. Following this, I solved 12 practice problems on Leetcode on these topics.

## Week 2 
In this week, I covered time and space complexity from both video lectures and the reference book. I then covered hashmaps and strings via lectures and then did 11 practice problems on Leetcode for the above.

## Week 3 
Here, I covered linked lists in the same manner as mentioned above and did 9 practice problems on Leetcode on the same.

## Week 4 
In week 4, I learnt recursion and back-tracking and did 8 Leetcode practice problems on the same.
